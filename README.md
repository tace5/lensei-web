# Lensei Admin
The Lensei Admin page is to be used for administering the [Lensei app](https://github.com/alestiago/google-solution-challenge). When logged in, admins can add, remove and edit products that can be scanned by the app.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses Next.js 10.0.8.

## Demo
You may find our two minute demonstration video [here](https://youtu.be/Vm8hjFXK3oc).

## Getting Started
1\. Clone the repository.

2\. Run the development server:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
3\. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

4\. Sign in with admin credentials. We don't have a registration page for security reasons but you can use our demo account:

Email: `demo@demo.com`

Password: `demopassword`

5\. Start adding products!

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
