# Lensei
Lensei is empowering you to make better decisions for the planet while shopping.

## Author's note
This project has been done as part of [Google Solution Challenge 2021](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge).

As part of the solution there is a Flutter Application (Check the [repository](https://github.com/alestiago/google-solution-challenge)), a NextJS Website (this repository) and a phsycial product.

This is still under development. Hence, you may encounter bugs (we hope not), but it is possible. You can read more about our future plans at the end of the document.

## Getting Started

1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/ingredients.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/ingredients.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
